Visualizing Algorithms for Neural Network Optimization

Visualizing SGD, Momentum-Assisted, and Accelerated SGD in 3-D Optimization Test functions (Rastrigin, Styblinski-Tang, Sphere), also generalizable to higher dimentions, using matplotlib.
Part of the code is taken from: http://louistiao.me/notes/visualizing-and-animating-optimization-algorithms-with-matplotlib/
